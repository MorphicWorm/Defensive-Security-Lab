# üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Security Lab

Welcome to my **Defensive Security Lab** ‚Äî a personal, hands-on learning space focused on simulating and detecting common attacker techniques such as persistence, process injection, and system tampering on Windows systems.

This repo is designed to demonstrate real-world investigation and detection skills using safe, malware-free simulations. Each lab focuses on specific techniques, tools, or scenarios.

## üî¨ Lab Environment Setup

All labs are run in a fully isolated virtual lab built on VirtualBox. The setup includes a Windows target system used for simulation and analysis, with room for expansion as new tools and skills are added.

### üñ•Ô∏è Virtual Machine Layout

| VM | Role | Tools/Configs |
|----|------|----------------|
| **Windows Server 2025** *(Victim VM)* | Primary system for persistence simulation and detection | RegShot, Process Explorer, PowerShell, Sysmon, Event Viewer |
| **(Optional) Analyst Workstation** | For future centralized log collection and IR tools | Splunk, Velociraptor, Wireshark, Notepad++ |
| **Network** | Internal virtual switch only (`SOC_Lab_Net`) | Dual NIC: NAT (for updates), Internal (lab communication only) |

## üîí Simulation Approach

- No real malware is used ‚Äî only safe batch files and EICAR test strings.
- Simulated persistence techniques (e.g., startup folder, Run keys, scheduled tasks).
- Focus on system changes, registry behavior, process trees, and autostarts.
- Labs are documented with snapshots, commands, and cleanup steps.
