# 🧪 Phishing Simulations (In Progress)

This folder contains **work-in-progress phishing simulation scenarios** designed for SOC analyst practice. The goal is to simulate realistic phishing incidents and analyze the resulting logs, alerts, and forensic artifacts.

These scenarios will help with hands-on experience in:
- Email header analysis
- Detecting suspicious attachments or URLs
- Investigating phishing delivery techniques
- Identifying indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Practicing alert triage and log correlation

## 🛠️ Work in Progress
This project is actively being developed. Simulations will be added over time and refined to support structured investigation workflows.

## 📁 Planned Folder Structure
Each simulation will be in its own folder and follow this structure:

```
phishing/
├── 01-header-anomaly/
│   ├── simulation.md       # Steps to simulate the scenario
│   ├── analysis.md         # Investigation and detection notes
│   └── evidence/           # Sample headers, attachments, logs, etc.
├── 02-malicious-attachment/
├── 03-url-redirection/
└── README.md
```

## 🧭 Simulation Naming Convention
Folder naming format:
```
<id>-<short-description>
```
Example:
```
01-header-anomaly
02-malicious-attachment
03-url-redirection
```

## 🔄 Current Status
| ID  | Simulation Name       | Status       | Notes                             |
|-----|------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------|
| 01  | Header Anomaly         | 🛠️ In Progress | Simulating spoofed email headers   |
| 02  | Malicious Attachment   | 🛠️ In Progress | Testing detection of suspicious attachments |
| 03  | URL Redirection        | 🛠️ In Progress | Investigating phishing URLs embedded in emails |
